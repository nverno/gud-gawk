* Markers [2/5]
** DONE breakpoint

** TODO next/step
Follow positions with =gud-gawk-marker-regexp=.
Need a way to differentiate from other output that looks the same:
#+begin_quote
<source_line> ....
#+end_quote

Could:
- add a call to =where= after =next[i]= and =step[i]=
- track whether previous command needs to be tracked - eg. another local
  variable that gets set in =comint-input-filter=
  This is probably better - cant really add =where= in all cases, eg. after
  =comint-send-input= with another =comint-input-filter= anyway.
